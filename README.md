dumb bash script that makes text print a lot i guess. specify what text you want and what intreval you want a new print to appear, and itll clear the screen and make that text print away and stuff

like this:

printer hii 0.5

or just not specify the number, itll default to 0.01s.

ok bai

(literally doing anything to get those commits up)
